#      be redirected to a file or to a different system (for example,	using
#      ssh(1)).  By default, a full stream is	generated.
#
#      -i snapshot
#          Generate an incremental stream	from the first snapshot	(the
#          incremental source) to	the second snapshot (the incremental
#          target).  The incremental source can be specified as the last

#          as the	incremental target.

#          shots,	descendent file	systems, and clones are	preserved.

#          much better if	the filesystem uses a dedup-capable checksum
#          (eg.  sha256).
#

#      -p	 Include the dataset's properties in the stream. This flag is

#          and the verbose output	goes to	standard error).

#
#      Creates a snapshot whose contents are as specified in the stream pro-
#      vided on standard input. If a full stream is received,	then a new
#      file system is	created	as well. Streams are created using the "zfs
#      send" subcommand, which by default creates a full stream.  "zfs recv"
#      can be	used as	an alias for "zfs receive".
#
#      If an incremental stream is received, then the	destination file sys-
#      tem must already exist, and its most recent snapshot must match the
#      incremental stream's source. For zvols, the destination device	link
#      is destroyed and recreated, which means the zvol cannot be accessed
#      during	the receive operation.
#
#      When a	snapshot replication package stream that is generated by using
#      the "zfs send -R" command is received,	any snapshots that do not
#      exist on the sending location are destroyed by	using the "zfs destroy
#      -d" command.
#
#      The name of the snapshot (and file system, if a full stream is
#      received) that	this subcommand	creates	depends	on the argument	type
#      and the -d or -e option.
#
#      If the	argument is a snapshot name, the specified snapshot is cre-
#      ated. If the argument is a file system	or volume name,	a snapshot
#      with the same name as the sent	snapshot is created within the speci-
#      fied filesystem or volume.  If	the -d or -e option is specified, the
#      snapshot name is determined by	appending the sent snapshot's name to
#      the specified filesystem.  If the -d option is	specified, all but the
#      pool name of the sent snapshot	path is	appended (for example, b/c@1
#      appended from sent snapshot a/b/c@1), and if the -e option is speci-
#      fied, only the	tail of	the sent snapshot path is appended (for	exam-
#      ple, c@1 appended from	sent snapshot a/b/c@1).	 In the	case of	-d,

#      are created within the	specified file system.

#          (without pool name) to	determine the name of the new snapshot
#          as described in the paragraph above.
#
#      -e	 Use only the last element of the sent snapshot	path to	deter-
#          mine the name of the new snapshot as described	in the para-
#          graph above.
#
#      -u	 File system that is associated	with the received stream is
#          not mounted.
#
#      -v	 Print verbose information about the stream and	the time
#          required to perform the receive operation.
#
#      -n	 Do not	actually receive the stream. This can be useful	in
#          conjunction with the -v option	to verify the name the receive
#          operation would use.
#
#      -o origin=snapshot
#          Forces	the stream to be received as a clone of	the given
#          snapshot.  If the stream is a full send stream, this will
#          create	the filesystem described by the	stream as a clone of
#          the specified snapshot. Which snapshot	was specified will not
#          affect	the success or failure of the receive, as long as the
#          snapshot does exist.  If the stream is	an incremental send
#          stream, all the normal	verification will be performed.
#
#      -F	 Force a rollback of the file system to	the most recent	snap-
#          shot before performing	the receive operation. If receiving an
#          incremental replication stream	(for example, one generated by
#          "zfs send -R {-i | -I}"), destroy snapshots and file systems
#          that do not exist on the sending side.
#
#      -s	 If the	receive	is interrupted,	save the partially received
#          state,	rather than deleting it.  Interruption may be due to
#          premature termination of the stream (e.g. due to network
#          failure or failure of the remote system if the	stream is
#          being read over a network connection),	a checksum error in
#          the stream, termination of the	zfs receive process, or
